# Notification System Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Discord-Style Visual Indicators

3. **Bell Icon in Header**
   - Shows notification status (Bell = enabled, BellOff = disabled)
   - Opens notification settings dialog
   - Located next to invite button in server header

### Browser Push Notifications

## üîß Backend Implementation

### User Model Additions

```javascript
notificationSettings: {
  type: Map,
  of: {
    enabled: Boolean,
    mutedChannels: [String]
  }
}
unreadMentions: {
  type: Map,
  of: [{
    serverId: String,
    channelId: String,
    messageId: String,
    timestamp: Date
  }]
}
pushSubscription: Object
```

### API Endpoints

1. `GET /api/notifications/settings/:serverId` - Get notification settings
2. `PUT /api/notifications/settings/:serverId` - Update notification settings
3. `GET /api/notifications/mentions` - Get all unread mentions
4. `DELETE /api/notifications/mentions/:serverId/:channelId` - Mark as read
5. `POST /api/notifications/subscribe` - Save push subscription
6. `DELETE /api/notifications/subscribe` - Remove push subscription

### Socket Events

- `newMention` - Emitted when user is mentioned
  ```javascript
  {
    serverId: string,
    channelId: string,
    channelName: string,
    messageId: string,
    messageText: string,
    senderUsername: string
  }
  ```

## üíª Frontend Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
const [notificationSettings, setNotificationSettings] = useState({
  enabled: false,
  mutedChannels: [],
});
const [unreadMentions, setUnreadMentions] = useState<Record<string, any[]>>({});
const [showNotificationSettings, setShowNotificationSettings] = useState(false);
const [pushNotificationsEnabled, setPushNotificationsEnabled] = useState(false);
```

### Helper Functions

1. `toggleServerNotifications()` - Enable/disable server notifications
2. `toggleChannelMute(channelName)` - Mute/unmute specific channel
3. `togglePushNotifications()` - Enable/disable browser push
4. `hasUnreadMentions(serverId, channelId)` - Check for unread mentions
5. `serverHasUnreadMentions(serverId)` - Check if server has any unread mentions

### useEffect Hooks

1. Load notification settings when server changes
2. Load unread mentions on mount
3. Listen for `newMention` socket events
4. Clear mentions when viewing channel (1 second delay)
5. Setup service worker for push notifications

## üé® UI Components

### Bell Icon Button

- Located in server header
- Shows Bell (enabled) or BellOff (disabled) icon
- Tooltip on hover
- Opens notification settings dialog

### Red Dot Indicators

- Absolute positioned on server icons
- Inline with channel names
- Red background (#ef4444)
- 2px border (black)
- Pulse animation
- Box shadow for glow effect

### Notification Settings Dialog

- Modal dialog with dark theme
- Server notifications toggle
- Browser push toggle
- Channel muting list
- Tip section with helpful info

## üîÑ Notification Flow

### When User is Mentioned

1. **Backend**:

   - Regex extracts mentions from message: `/@(\w+)/g`
   - Checks if mentioned user exists
   - Checks notification settings (enabled, not muted)
   - Adds to `unreadMentions` Map in database
   - Emits `newMention` socket event
   - Sends browser push notification via web-push

2. **Frontend**:
   - Receives `newMention` socket event
   - Updates local `unreadMentions` state
   - Red dot appears on server icon
   - Red dot appears on channel name
   - Browser push notification sent (if enabled)

### When User Views Channel

1. Timer starts (1 second delay)
2. After delay, marks mentions as read
3. Sends DELETE request to backend
4. Removes from `unreadMentions` Map in database
5. Updates local state
6. Red dots disappear

## üìä Database Schema

### User.notificationSettings (Map)

```
Key: serverId (String)
Value: {
  enabled: Boolean,
  mutedChannels: [String]
}
```

### User.unreadMentions (Map)

```
Key: "serverId_channelId" (String)
Value: [{
  serverId: String,
  channelId: String,
  messageId: String,
  timestamp: Date
}]
```

### User.pushSubscription (Object)

```javascript
{
  endpoint: String,
  keys: {
    p256dh: String,
    auth: String
  }
}
```

## üîê Security & Privacy

1. **VAPID Keys**: Secure authentication for push notifications
2. **User Permission**: Browser asks for notification permission
3. **Per-Server Settings**: Users control notifications per server
4. **Channel Muting**: Fine-grained control over notifications
5. **Subscription Management**: Invalid subscriptions auto-removed

## üöÄ Next Steps (Setup Required)

1. Install web-push: `npm install web-push` in backend ‚úÖ (Already installed)
2. Generate VAPID keys: `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`
3. Add VAPID keys to `.env` file
4. Update frontend with VAPID public key
5. Restart backend server
6. Test notifications

## üì± Testing Checklist

- [ ] Red dot appears on server icon when mentioned
- [ ] Red dot appears on channel name when mentioned
- [ ] Red dots disappear when viewing channel
- [ ] Bell icon toggles notification settings
- [ ] Server notifications can be enabled/disabled
- [ ] Channels can be muted/unmuted
- [ ] Browser push notifications work when app is closed
- [ ] Clicking notification navigates to correct channel
- [ ] Settings persist across sessions

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

1. VAPID keys must be manually configured
2. Push notifications require HTTPS (localhost exempt)
3. Safari requires iOS 16+ for full support
4. Service worker must be manually cleared if issues occur

## üìö Additional Notes

- Notification settings are stored per-server in MongoDB
- Unread mentions are tracked with serverId_channelId keys
- Service worker handles push events independently
- Red dots use CSS animations for smooth pulse effect
- Bell icon state reflects current server's settings
